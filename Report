OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project was to design, simulate, and test a 2-bit binary adder circuit. A 2-bit binary adder is a digital circuit used to add two binary numbers. The goal was to ensure the circuit correctly computes the sum and the carry for all possible input combinations.


2. CIRCUIT DESIGN 
2.1 SCHEMATIC OVERVIEW
The 2-bit binary adder consists of two half adder circuits connected in series. Each half adder is responsible for adding the corresponding bits of the input numbers and the carry from the initial adder.
	Inputs: A1, A0 ( first 2-bit number)
-	B1, B0 (second 2-bit number)
	Outputs: Sum1, Sum0, Carry out

The circuit consists of:
	Two Half adders
	Logic Gates: AND, OR and XOR gates that are used to implement the full adder logic.

Each half adder takes two input bits and carry-in bit, producing a sum and a carry-out bit. The carry-out from the first half adder serves as the carry-in for the second full adder.

3. SIMULATION PROCESS
3.1 SIMULATION ENVIRONMENT 
The circuit was simulated using Digital Works. The tool provides a digital circuit simulation environment, allowing verification of the functionality of the design before hardware implementation.

4.1 TEST CASES
The testing strategy focused on validating the correctness of the adder’s output for all possible input combinations. The following test cases were applied:
1.	A = 00, B = 00
Expected Output: Sum = 00, Carry = 0

2.	A = 01, B = 01
Expected Output: Sum = 10, Carry = 0

3.	A = 10, B = 10
Expected Output: Sum = 00, Carry = 1

4.	A = 11, B = 11
Expected Output: Sum = 10, Carry = 1
